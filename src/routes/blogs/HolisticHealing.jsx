            <Text color="green.900">

              focuses on prevention, holistic wellness, and natural remedies, while modern medicine
              excels in acute care, diagnostics, and surgical interventions. Together, they provide a
              more complete approach to health.

              treatments. Combining both can create a more precise and effective treatment plan.
