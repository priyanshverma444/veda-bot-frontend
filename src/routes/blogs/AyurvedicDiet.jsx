            <Text color="green.900">
              In Ayurveda, doshas are the fundamental energies that govern our physical and mental processes. There are three primary doshas:
            </Text>
            <UnorderedList>
              <ListItem color="green.900"><strong>Vata</strong> (Air and Ether): Governs movement, circulation, and communication.</ListItem>
              <ListItem color="green.900"><strong>Pitta</strong> (Fire and Water): Controls digestion, metabolism, and energy production.</ListItem>
              <ListItem color="green.900"><strong>Kapha</strong> (Earth and Water): Provides structure, lubrication, and stability.</ListItem>
            </UnorderedList>
            <Text color="green.900">
              Each person has a unique combination of these doshas, which influences their physical and mental characteristics. Imbalances in doshas can lead to health issues, and diet is a key factor in maintaining balance.
